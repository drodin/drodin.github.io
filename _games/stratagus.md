Stratagus can be used to play several RTS games on your device including:

* **Wargus** - Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness & Beyond the Dark Portal (expansion pack) clone, which uses content from original Blizzard games CDs.
* **Stargus** - partial Starcraft I clone, also uses content from original CD.

Installation:
=============

You will need to provide 'game data files' to actually play anything, to create data:

Wargus (Warcraft II +expansion):
--------------------------------

* Download latest version of Stratagus apk [Stratagus-v3.0.0-dev1.apk](https://github.com/drodin/Stratagus/releases/download/v3.0.0-dev1/Stratagus-v3.0.0-dev1.apk)
* Download [Wargus-3.0.0-dev1.zip](https://github.com/drodin/wargus/releases/download/v3.0.0-dev1/Wargus-3.0.0-dev1.zip).
* Extract and run `wargus.exe`
* Select the disk or folder with Warcraft II CD.
* It can take up to couple of minutes to extract the data, if it stops right away, something is wrong with your CD.
* You can quit the game or continue playing on your desktop. ;)
* Copy `%APPDATA%\Stratagus\data.Wargus` folder to your device SD card.
* Select this folder in the start dialog.

> Note: to access `AppData` folder, enter `%APPDATA%` int the Windows Explorer address bar

Stargus (Starcraft I, partial):
-------------------------------

* Stratagus is not currently supported by v3.0.0-dev1

* Run, select the folder for data extraction (`C:\Stratagus\data.sc` by default)
* Select the disk or folder with Starcraft I CD.
