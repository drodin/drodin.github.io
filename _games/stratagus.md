Stratagus can be used to play several RTS games on your device including:

* [Wargus](http://stratagus.com/games/wargus/) - Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness & Beyond the Dark Portal (expansion pack) clone, which uses content from original Blizzard games CDs.
* [Stargus](http://stratagus.com/games/stargus/) - partial Starcraft I clone, also uses content from original CD.

Installation:
=============

Download latest version of Stratagus apk, and install it.

You will need to provide 'game data files' to actually play anything, to create data:

Wargus (Warcraft II +expansion):
--------------------------------

* Download installer [Wargus-1.2-android.exe](https://github.com/downloads/drodin/Stratagus/Wargus-1.2-android.exe) ([x86_64](https://github.com/downloads/drodin/Stratagus/Wargus-1.2-android-x86_64.exe)).
* Run, select the folder for data extraction (`C:\Stratagus\data.wc2` by default)
* Select the disk or folder with Warcraft II CD.
* It can take up to couple of minutes to extract the data, if it stops right away, something is wrong with your CD.
* Copy whole folder `data.wc2` to your device SD card.

> Note: as there is currently no audio support, you can delete `music` and `sounds` subfolders from `data.wc2` folder.

Stargus (Starcraft I, partial):
-------------------------------

* Download installer [Stargus-1.0-android.exe](https://github.com/downloads/drodin/Stratagus/Stargus-1.0-android.exe) ([x86_64](https://github.com/downloads/drodin/Stratagus/Stargus-1.0-android-x86_64.exe)).
* Run, select the folder for data extraction (`C:\Stratagus\data.sc` by default)
* Select the disk or folder with Starcraft I CD.
* You will see the extraction process, if the extraction stops right away, smth. is wrong with your CD.

Run Stratagus application on your Android device. Browse to `data.wc2` or `data.sc` data folder on your SD card. Select it and press 'Start Game'. ENJOY =)
